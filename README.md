## React training starter

### Starting the project

```
yarn && yarn start

// or

npm install && npm start
```

### Project structure

`src` - source code folder where our React code will live

`src/icons` - we've got some icons prepared for the project and saved as React components

`public` - static files available in the project, used for storing index.html file with the root element for the React application

### Checkpoints

If you feel stuck or lost during the training - we've got you covered with checkpoints for each task. Just grab an src folder from any checkpoints and put it instead of the main src folder.
